/**
 * Set the ticket price
 * --------------------
 * Description
 * When choosing a ticket you are guided not only by your space preference but also by your finances. Let's implement
 * the opportunity to check the ticket price and see the reserved seat.
 * --------------------
 * Objectives
 * Read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row and print the seating
 * arrangement like in the first stage. Then, read two integer numbers from the input: a row number and a seat number
 * in that row. These numbers represent the coordinates of the seat according to which the program should print the
 * ticket price. The ticket price is determined by the same rules as the previous stage:
 * - If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
 * - In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half.
 *   Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows,
 *   and the second half is the last 5 rows.
 * After that, the program should print out all the seats in the screen room as shown in the example and mark the chosen
 * seat by the B symbol. Finally, it should print the ticket price and stop. Note that in this project, the number of
 * rows and seats won't be greater than 9.
