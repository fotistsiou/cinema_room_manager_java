## About
In this project, you will build a program that automates cinema theatre management. You will utilize key Java concepts, 
including working with input/output operations, handling arrays, creating functions, and using loops and conditional 
statements.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course 
to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

* Stage 1/5: Print seats
  * Visualize the seating arrangement by printing it to the console.
  * Stage Topics:

  * Add a menu that allows you to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement.
  * Stage Topics:
    * Declaring methods
    * Method "main"
    * Multiple conditions: switch
    * Functional decomposition
    * Arrays as parameters
